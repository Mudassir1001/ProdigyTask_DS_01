Introduction
Understanding the distribution of ages within a population is crucial for various analyses and decision-making processes. 
This project simplifies the process by providing a Python script to create a bar chart visualisation.

Getting Started
Data Preparation
Ensure you have the relevant population data in an Excel file (e.g., "2.1_Population_dynamics.xlsx") located in the same directory as your script.
The Excel file should contain a column with age data (e.g., 'Age').
Running the Script
Open a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).
Copy and paste the provided code for creating a bar chart visualization into your Python environment.
3.Executing the Visualization

Run the script.
The code will load the data, process it, and create a bar chart representing the age distribution in the population dataset.
